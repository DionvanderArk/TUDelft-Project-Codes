# GMAT scripts

This folder contains all the GMAT scripts I made for Project. To run them, open the file in [GMAT](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gmat/) and run the script. They are in my Github as they would take too much space for the Appendix.

For now the only script in here is the Earth to Mars transfer and capture script including stationkeeping.
