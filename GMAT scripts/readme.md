# GMAT scripts

This folder contains all the GMAT scripts I made for Project. To run them, open the file in [GMAT](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gmat/) and run the script. They are in my Github as they would take too much space for the Appendix.

# Note eclipselocator script
To run the eclipselocator script lines 9 and 10 have to be removed from the script as the path will be incorrect, and now after opening the script, double click on the "SolarSystem" folder and change the Ephemeris source to "SPICE", otherwise the eclispelocator will run into errors.

# ADSEE
Aditionally, there is a quick ADSEE II script that I designed to analyze the equatorial shift of the given CAPSTONE mission as the payload swath angle seemed way too big. Note that for the CAPSTONE mission it is nowhere near as complicated as the original orbit, as it is a simplified 1600 km circular polar orbit by the assignment.
